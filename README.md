# Sudoku-
Backtracking algorithm
This is my first project in python 3
In this project I have created an program which can solve sudoku puzzle by backtrack algorithm using NumPy.
In this program I have converted the puzzles into an string and then converted into an array.
I have provided some examples in the code itself.
Run the program.
